# Jokes-Generator
A simple web application that fetches and displays a random joke from the Jokes API.

## How It Works
1. **Fetch Jokes**: The jokes are fetched from the [Official Joke API](https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/jokes/random/250).
2. **Next Joke**: When the "Next" button is clicked, the next joke is displayed.
3. **Previous Joke**: When the "Previous" button is clicked, the previous joke is displayed.
4. **Loading State**: While the jokes are being fetched, a message ("Loading jokes, please wait...") is shown to the user.
5. **Error Handling**: If thereâ€™s an issue fetching the jokes, an error message will be displayed.
